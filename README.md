# Simple Pong Game

A classic Pong game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

*   Single-player mode against an AI opponent.
*   Mouse control for the left paddle.
*   Basic collision detection and ball physics.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5 Canvas
*   CSS for styling
*   JavaScript for game logic

## How to Play

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Move your mouse up and down to control the left paddle.
3.  Try to prevent the ball from passing your paddle.
4.  The game resets when the ball goes out of bounds.

## Files

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the game canvas and includes the JavaScript and CSS files.
*   `style.css`:  CSS file for styling the game elements.
*   `game.js`: JavaScript file containing the game logic, including paddle movement, ball physics, collision detection, and the game loop.

## Game Logic

The `game.js` file contains the core game logic:

*   **Canvas Setup:**  Sets up the HTML5 canvas and gets the 2D rendering context.
*   **Game Constants:** Defines constants for paddle size, ball size, ball speed, and AI speed.
*   **Paddle Movement:**  Updates the left paddle position based on mouse movement. The AI controls the right paddle.
*   **Ball Physics:**  Updates the ball position and handles collisions with the top, bottom, and paddles.
*   **Collision Detection:** Detects collisions between the ball and the paddles.
*   **Game Loop:**  The main game loop that updates the game state and draws the game elements on the canvas.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the constants in the `game.js` file:

*   `PADDLE_W`: Paddle width.
*   `PADDLE_H`: Paddle height.
*   `BALL_SIZE`: Ball size.
*   `BALL_SPEED`: Ball speed.
*   `AI_SPEED`: AI paddle speed.

You can also modify the colors in the `style.css` file to change the appearance of the game.

## Next Steps

Here are some ideas for improving the game:

*   Implement scoring.
*   Add a start screen and game over screen.
*   Implement two-player mode.
*   Increase the ball speed as the game progresses.
*   Improve the AI.
